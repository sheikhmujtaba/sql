    What is Correlation?
    </h2>
    <p>
   Correlation is a relationship between two variables and how a change in one variable causes the change in the other variable. For instance, you can check how a parentâ€™s height relate to the height of their children. Moreover, when you graph a scatter plot for the two variables, the closer the data points are to the trend line the stronger the relationship between the two variables. Lastly, there must be a linear relationship between the two variables to entitle their relationship as a correlation.

    <h2>
    Correlation and Causation
    </h2>
    <p>
    Correlation is a relation between two variables, whereas causation is the reason why this relationship exists and what makes this relationship between the two variables strong enough to impact each other. The best way to calculate causation is to run controlled experiments using the variables, but it is usually infeasible. Therefore, the best way to determine causation is to check the strength of the relation between the two variables and compare it to other alternative relations. Moreover, we need to make sure that a change in one variable causes a consistent change in the other. Lastly, the causation must make logical sense.

    Different ways to visually represent correlation.
    </h2>
    <p>
    Firstly, we can use smoothers like the LOWESS (locally weighted scatter plot) to divide the plot into several sections and show the trend of each section with the LOWESS. Smoothers show us the trend of the graph using the data provided without manipulating the data in any way. Moreover, you can always add new data and get a new LOWESS for each data set. Secondly, we can use matrix to show relation between multiple variables. For instance, scatter plot matrix allows us to see the relationship between more than two variables as in the examples he divided the sat scores and created a scatter plot matrix which showed divided into other sub sections and from there we could determine which variables had a better correlation and use that to determine causation in our data. Lastly, we can use parallel coordinates plot to visualize multivariate data. However, we have to organize the variables to display the patterns between the variables and then we have to add interactivity to make it easier for the reader to understand. Parallel coordinates plot seems a little messy, but there is a lot of insight that can be gained from this visualization.
