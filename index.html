    How does inner join work?
    </h2>
    <p>
   Inner join joins tables which have the same value for a specific column. Inner join will merge the information on two different tables into one table for a specific value. For instance, if we have order numbers, but there are two tables which have different information about each order. We can use inner join to merge information for each order number from both tables into one table. With inner join you can merge more than two tables as well.

    In addition, data scientists' model that data and create visualizations to communicate their findings and what would be the best possible decision for the firm related to a specific problem. Furthermore, once the model is applied a data scientist monitors if the model continues to work in the future with more data.
